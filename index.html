        <h1>|Welcome To The world of Dance and love|</h1>

        <p>There is a time when you just needed to relax
     and think gratefully to God for the gift of life and the
     nature around you.This is important in our life. Everything is 
     simply fantastic when we allow God and nature play vital roles 
     in our relationship. Do you dance with a smile in your face 
     beholding your better-half? Have you really consider the fact
     that there're many out there who seek to do that?Better reason 
     this and be grateful to God. Life is just short and once ok________I'm Ray and this concept is known as raywisation! Believe it or leave it!
